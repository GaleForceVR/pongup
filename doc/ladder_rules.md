# Ladder Rules

## Overview

Rules are based on the most common forms of [ladder tournaments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladder_tournament "Wikipedia: Ladder tournament") in table tennis, tennis, badminton and other similar sports.

Players are initialy ranked by the Ladder Manager in reverse order of ability. Highest ranked players are placed at the bottom and they must fight their way to the top. (This method will most likely be replaced with a global rating system or a hybrid of the two in the near future)

A player may challenge anyone within 2 rungs above them on the ladder. The challenged player must accept the challenges in first come first serve order and must accept at least one challenge each week, only one challenge may be accepted at a time. Once a challenge has been made, it cannot be cancelled, even if the rankings of the players change. If a player fails to play a match in any given week, they will be penalized 2 rungs on the ladder.

If the higher ranked player wins, there is no change in the rankings. If the lower ranked player wins, the lower ranked player takes the ranking of the higher ranked player who drops one spot.

If you loose to a player, you may not challenge them until you have challenged at least one other player first.

Winner is responsible for reporting score within 3 hours of scheduled match time. If score is not reported, higher ranked player will drop one spot, and lower ranked player will stay where they are. If players are adjacent in the rankings, then the players will swap positions.
